# ASP.NET-core-Web-API
I am learning ASP.NET core web API deeply with hands On and doing projects  

What is ASP.NET core and why it is needed?

Difference Between Website and WebApplication:
website is a static page that shows content to the user not changes anything it have
on the other hand WebApplication is to show content to the user that is getting from the backend and dynamically changes
