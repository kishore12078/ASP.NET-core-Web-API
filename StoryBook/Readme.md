# STORY BOOK
### What?
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is Playground for UI components and it runs outside of the main react components and we need to worry about the dependencies and libraries in the react that won’t affect the story points and it is isolated development environments.
### Why?
* We can easily view the different components used in the react applications and know the different props that are used in the react components.
* And we can get the feedback from stakeholders by showing this UI and dynamically changing the props that is if we change one props to another, we can show to the client from frontend itself not go to the source code and he can easily understand what’s going on.
